## Description:

iBudget v2 is a project that serves as an All-In-One (AIO) financial calculator targetting aspects of budgeting, investing, portfolio management, etc.

This project is derived from the original iBudget code in the solo react project, and then upgraded to include new features, new approaches, and optimized code.

#### Original iBudget development repo: 
https://github.com/TheCaptainFalcon/DC_Week14

## Purpose: 

This project was built to provide a method in calculating one's budget based on income and expense values, determining estimated investment valuations, comparing said investments to one another, and calculating target dates in large purchases.

While there are many other methods and calculators online, more often than not, I find that they are disconnected from achieving a similar goal.

This app helps to aid in that purpose.

## Main Features:

- Calculator input fields for income and expense values to determine budgets.
- Results component that compiles all inserted data in an extensive breakdown/analysis.
- ContextAPI implementation to avoid prop drilling and efficiently pass through the many channels for needed state/prop values.
- Comparison between investment growth and loan/installment plans to best determine large purchases, while maximizing benefits in opportunity cost.
- Calculating target debts based on factors including: contribution, compounding interest, specific timelines, etc.
